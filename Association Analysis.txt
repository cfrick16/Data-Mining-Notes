Walmart = BIG

Terminology: 
	Transaction width: Number of items in transaction
	ItemSet: any collection of - or more items Ex {Eggs, 	Beer}
	k-itemSet: Item set of size k
	A transaction contains Itemset x: if x is a subset of 
		the transaction, Ex: {Bread Diaper, beer, eggs 	
		contains {bread Diapers}}
	Support count[o(X)]: Number of transactions that count
		contain itemset
	Minsup: Set by me, Minimum support count needed

Association Rule Mining:
	Support >= minsup threshold
	Confidence >= minconfidence threshold

Associaition Rule Mining Steps
	1. Frequent Itemset Generation: Find all the itemsets 
		that satisfy minsup
	2. Strong Rule generation: Find all the rules in the
		frequent itemsets that satisfy minconf

Frequent Itemset Generation
	Apriori Principle: If an itemset is frequent then all 
		of its subsets must also be frequent. Also if an 
		itemset is infrequent then all of its supersets 
		are also infrequent
	1. Go to individual items, if they don't meet the 
		minsup remove them
	2. Generatate sets of size two with items that meet 
		minsup, remove those that don't reach minsup
	3. Check if any subset does not meet minsup. Ex) if 
		you join {beer, milk} {milk,  eggs} because both 
		are greater than minsup, however if {beer, eggs} 
		does not meet minsup then remove {beer, eggs, 
		milk} without counting 
	4. Continue until no more remain
