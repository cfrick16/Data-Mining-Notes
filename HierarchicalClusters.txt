	Agglomerative: Starts with points as individual clusters and at each step merges the closest pair of clusters
	Divisive: Start with one all-inclusive cluster at each step split until only one individual point remains

Defining Proximity:
	Centroid Distance
	Distance of The closest points in a cluster
