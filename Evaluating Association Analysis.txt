Evaluating Association Analysis
	- After running Association Analysis, we may have hundreds of "Rules", we need to decide which rules are best

Definitions:
	Support   : Fraction of transactions that contain both X and Y; P(Y,X)
	Confidence: Meausures how often item in Y appear in transactions that contain X; P(Y|X)
	Lift      : Ratio of how often they are bought together to how often they should be bought together if they were 	
				independent; P(Y,X)/(P(X)*P(Y))

Limitations of Support and Confidence
	- There are times when both support adn nconfidence are high but the rule produced is not good
	Ex) Orange Juice -> Milk, 30% support, 75% Confidence; Milk, 90% Support
	- Confidence ignores the support of milk

Lift: Meausures the ratio of the obserbed frequency of co-occurrence to the expected frequency (AKA surprise or interest)
	- Probability that they are bought together divided by the probability that they are bought together if they were 	independent
	- Lift(X->Y) = (P(X,Y))/(P(X)P(Y))
	- If X and Y were independent lift(X->Y)=1
	Ex) Orange Juice -> Milk, 30% Support, 75% Confidence
		Milk                , 90% Support
		OJ                  , 40% Support
		Lift(OJ->Milk) =.75/.9 =.3/(.4 * .9)=.83
		- Since Lift<1, this indicates that there is a negative correlation between milk and OJ
		- People that buy milk hate OJ, it has been proven
		- Uri's Hypothesis: "If you do both then you will be shitting your pants."

Contingency Table
	[         Tea   ~Tea         ]
	[ Coffee  150    50     200  ]
	[~Coffee  650    150    800  ]
	[         800    200    1000 ]

	- Lift(X->Y) = P(X,Y)/(P(X)*P(Y)) = (f11/N)/((f1,/N)(f,1/N)) = (N*f11)/(f1, * f,1) = (1000*150)/(200*800) = .94


Redundant Rules
	- Given two rules that have the same consequent
		- R: X->Y and R': W->Y, such that W is a subset of X
		- R: {Diapers, Milk}->{Beer}, R'L {Diapers}->{Beer}
	- R is considered more general than R' and is removed if R' has the same support because it is more specific

Productive Rules
	- Given two rules that have the same consequent:
		R: X->Y and R': W->Y, such that W is a subset of X
		R: {Diapers, Milk}->{Beer}, R':{Diapers}->{Beer}
	- Define the Improvement of a rules as
		imp(X->Y)=c(X->Y)-max{c(X1->Y), c(X2->Y), ..., c(Xn->Y)} where X1, X2 ... Xn are subsets of X
		c(X->Y) = S(X,Y)/S(Y)
